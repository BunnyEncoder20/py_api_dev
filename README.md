- Will be using this repo for learning API development using Python.

### Tech Stack

- **Fast API**: Cause it's build keeping api development in mind and also has a auto documentation feature (becasue it is important to document how an api works)
- **Postgres**: SQL database (almost all the same)
- **SQL Alchemy**: ORM, most standard one for python frameworks, most popular
